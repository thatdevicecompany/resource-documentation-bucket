The Groups API is used to create and list groups. A group is a representation of a collection of
items, be it a Bookmark, Application, Feed, Contact etc. One of the aforementioned resources will always belong to a group,
therefore you can receive the content of a group once you know the groups information. Think of the Groups API as a collection of
specific resources. The group itself also holds all of the access control for resources within it.

In the context of a Breezie device tablet, groups will appear as categories within the Interests application, with their content
appearing within each category.
