`Settings` is a representation of a set of properties that defines the Device behaviour.

The set of properties that can be set on a Device are defined in a `schema` that can be found on

restrictions.

[NOTE]
`Settings` can be defined at different levels: <<resources-device-settings, breezie level>>, <<organizations-micro-service, organization level>>
and user level. Properties defined at Breezie level can be overwritten at Organization and User level and properties
set at Organization level can be overwritten at User level.

[NOTE]
The `Settings` applied to a <<device-micro-service,device>> is the combination of Breezie Settings, Organizations Settings
and User Settings. In the event that the same property is defined at different levels, the User level
has the highest priority and Breezie level the lowest.
