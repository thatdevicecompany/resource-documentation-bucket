The Groups API is used to create and list 'Groups'. A Group is a representation of a collection of
items, be it a Bookmark, Application, Feed, Contact etc. One of the aforementioned resources will always belong to a Group,
therefore you can receive the content of a Group once you know the Group's information. It can be helpful to think of the Groups API as a collection of
specific resources. The Group itself also holds all of the access control for resources within it.

In the context of a Breezie tablet device, Groups will appear as categories within the Interests application, with their content
appearing within each category.
