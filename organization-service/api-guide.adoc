An `organization` is a representation of an institution where other resources of the system like `users`, `devices`,
`contents`... will be allocated. This resource is the top of an pyramidal structure called <<scope,scope>> composed by
`facilities`, `campuses`, `regions` and `organizations`.

[[resources-orgSettings]]
==== Settings
`Settings` is a representation of a set of properties that define the device behaviour.

[NOTE]
The set of properties that can be set on a device is defined in a `schema` available on
`https://api.breezie.com/devices/schema.json`. This json document describes all the properties available and their
restrictions.

[NOTE]
`Settings` can be defined at different levels: <<resources-device-settings, breezie level>>, organization level
and <<users-micro-service,user level>>. Properties defined at Breezie level can be overwritten at organization and user level and properties
set at organization level can be overwritten at user level.

[NOTE]
The `Settings` applied to a <<device-micro-service,device>> is the combination of breezie settings, organizations settings
and user settings. In case the same property is defined at different levels, user level
has the highest priority and Breezie level the lowest.
